Introduction - muddled
Rhetorical questions - hide research question.
Thesis and supporting reason - not clearly presented

Better if the argument was clearly expressed per module guidance.

> flagging the structure of the discussion
	(what each bit of evidence does to support the argument)



A lot of first person (narrative and rhetoric) 
only in the introduction and the conclusion.



> develop evidence with examples and illustrations - and also some pictures
(not assume familiarity with specific games)





(Publication facts Mr Technology.)


You will have a much better essay if you can structure and illustrate it properly.
